REGULAR EXPRESSION:

 * Regular Expression (RE) is used to check whether the given text matches with the given pattern or not.
 * To use RE we want to import System.Text.RegularExpressions;
 * Before giving the pattern for RE we want to use "@". 
 * For using RE we use Regex.There are various Regex expressions.
 * To match the string we use "Match" method.
 * The different expressions in RE are
 
     1) " * " - Use to print preceding character.
     
     EG:
     using System;
     using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

     namespace RE
     {
     class Program
     {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
        
            // This will return any pattern b, ab, aab etc.,
            Regex exp = new Regex(@"a*b");
            Match text = exp.Match("aabbb");
            if (text.Success)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(text.Value);
            }
        }
      }
    }
    
    Other expressions are "+" , "?" , "{n}" 
    
    There are also some special characters in Regex.Some of them are
    
    1) ^
    2) $
    3) .(DOT)
    4) \D
    5) \w
    
    EG FOR \w
    
    //It is use to match any alphanumeric and underscore character.
    Regex regex = new Regex(@"\w");

            Match match = regex.Match("Hello all how are you 34");

            if (match.Success)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Match Value: " + match.Value);
            }
            
    There is also various character classes also.
    
    
    COMMON LANGUAGE RUNTIME (CLR)
    
    CLR is a run-time environment produced by .NET to run codes and provide services.It is responsible for execution of .NET and can manage any 
    .NET programming language.
    
    The codes that run under CLR are called as Managed code.
    
    Some of the main components of CLR are :
     
    1) Common Language Specification (CLS)
    2) Common Type System (CTS)
    3) Garbage Collection (GC)
    4) Just In â€“ Time Compiler (JIT)
    
    Talking about how c# compiler works, When you run the C# compiler, it takes your code as an input, does some processing, 
    and then outputs your program in intermediate language (IL) code which is saved in *.exe or *. dll files. ... 
    It uses a just-in-time, or JIT, compiler to translate the IL code into machine code
   
    Common Language Specification:
    
    It is responsible for converting various .NET Programming language into CLR understandable format.
    
    Common Type System(CTS):
   
    CTS is responsible for understanding every data types in .NET programming.
   
    GARBAGE COLLECTOR:
    
    It is used for automatic memory management feature.It automatically allocates and deallocates memory.
    
    Jusi In Time Compiler (JIT):
    
    It is responsible for converting the Intermediate Language to machine codes.
