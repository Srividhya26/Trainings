FILES :

  Files is the collection of datas stored in a directory whith specific names and path.Once the file is opened it becomes streams.

STREAMS:

  Streams are the sequence of bytes.There are two types of streams
    i) input stream - It is used for reading the data in a file using read operation
    ii) output stream - It is used for writing the datas into the file using write operation
    
 There are various I/O classes for doing various operations in the file.To use file we want to include "using Systems.IO" in our program.
 
 Some of the I/O operations are 
    1)Stream reader
    2)Stream writer
    3)String reader
    4)String writer
    5)Binary reader
    6)Binary writer and so many...
    
    using System;
    using System.IO
    {
 
           bool isFileExists = File.Exists(@"C:\ HtmlFile.txt"); => It is used to check whether particular file present or not.
 
           File.Copy(@"C:\HtmlFile.txt", @"D:\DummyFile.txt"); => It is used to copy one file to another file
 
           File.Move(@"C:\HtmlFile.txt", @"D:\HtmlFile.txt"); => It is used to move the file to another location
 
           FileStream fs = File.Open(@"D:\HtmlFile.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate); => It is used to open the file
 
           File.Delete(@"C:\HtmlFile.txt"); => It is used to delete a file
   }
